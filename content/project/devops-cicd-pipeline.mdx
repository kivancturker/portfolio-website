# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Automation

A comprehensive DevOps solution implementing automated CI/CD pipelines with infrastructure as code, enabling fast, reliable, and scalable software delivery.

## Project Overview

<Callout type="info">
  Designed and implemented a complete DevOps ecosystem that reduced deployment
  time from hours to minutes while ensuring 99.9% deployment success rate.
</Callout>

## Architecture Components

### CI/CD Pipeline Tools

- **Jenkins** for continuous integration and deployment
- **Docker** for containerization and consistency
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **AWS** as the cloud platform

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Prometheus** for metrics collection
- **Grafana** for visualization and dashboards
- **ELK Stack** for centralized logging
- **Jaeger** for distributed tracing

## Pipeline Implementation

### Continuous Integration

```yaml
# Jenkinsfile example
pipeline {
    agent {
        kubernetes {
            yaml """
                apiVersion: v1
                kind: Pod
                spec:
                  containers:
                  - name: docker
                    image: docker:latest
                    command:
                    - cat
                    tty: true
                    volumeMounts:
                    - mountPath: /var/run/docker.sock
                      name: docker-sock
                  volumes:
                  - name: docker-sock
                    hostPath:
                      path: /var/run/docker.sock
            """
        }
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t app:${BUILD_NUMBER} .'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            parallel {
                stage('Unit Tests') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'npm test'
                    }
                }
                stage('Security Scan') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'trivy image app:${BUILD_NUMBER}'
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Infrastructure as Code

<CodeBlock lang="hcl">
# Terraform AWS EKS cluster configuration
resource "aws_eks_cluster" "main" {
  name     = var.cluster_name
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.cluster.arn
  version  = var.kubernetes_version

vpc_config {
subnet_ids = var.subnet_ids
endpoint_private_access = true
endpoint_public_access = true
public_access_cidrs = var.public_access_cidrs
}

encryption_config {
provider {
key_arn = aws_kms_key.cluster.arn
}
resources = ["secrets"]
}

depends_on = [
aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.cluster_AmazonEKSClusterPolicy,
aws_cloudwatch_log_group.cluster,
]
}

</CodeBlock>

## Automation Features

### Deployment Strategies

- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime releases
- **Canary Deployments**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
- **Feature Flags**: Dynamic feature enabling/disabling
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Automatic failure recovery

### Security Integration

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Security pipeline script
set -e

echo "Running security checks..."

# SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=$PROJECT_KEY

# Container security scanning
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL $IMAGE_NAME

# Infrastructure security
checkov -f terraform/ --framework terraform

# Secrets scanning
gitleaks detect --source . --verbose

echo "Security checks completed!"
```

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Metrics Collection

- **Application Metrics**: Response times, error rates, throughput
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network usage
- **Business Metrics**: User engagement, conversion rates
- **Security Metrics**: Failed logins, suspicious activities

### Alert Management

<CodeBlock lang="yaml">
# Prometheus alerting rules
groups:
- name: application.rules
  rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.1
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High error rate detected"
      description: "Error rate is {{ $value }} for {{ $labels.instance }}"

- alert: HighLatency
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 0.5
  for: 10m
  labels:
  severity: warning
  annotations:
  summary: "High latency detected"
  </CodeBlock>

## Performance Optimizations

### Build Optimization

- **Multi-stage Docker builds**: Reduced image sizes by 70%
- **Parallel testing**: 50% faster test execution
- **Cached dependencies**: 80% faster builds
- **Incremental builds**: Only build changed components

### Resource Efficiency

- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand
- **Spot instances**: 60% cost reduction for non-critical workloads
- **Resource limits**: Prevent resource exhaustion

## Results & Impact
