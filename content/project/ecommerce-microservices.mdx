# E-Commerce Platform with Microservices Architecture

This project demonstrates a scalable e-commerce platform built using microservices architecture, showcasing modern development practices and cloud-native technologies.

## Project Overview

<Callout type="info">
  This project was built to handle high-traffic e-commerce operations with
  independent, scalable services that can be deployed and maintained separately.
</Callout>

## Architecture Components

### Core Services

- **User Service**: Authentication, user management, and profiles
- **Product Service**: Product catalog, inventory management
- **Order Service**: Order processing and order history
- **Payment Service**: Payment processing and transaction management
- **Notification Service**: Email and SMS notifications

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis for caching
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for inter-service communication
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for production deployment

## Key Features

### Scalability

- Independent service scaling based on demand
- Load balancing across service instances
- Auto-scaling capabilities in Kubernetes

### Resilience

```javascript
// Example circuit breaker implementation
const CircuitBreaker = require("opossum");

const options = {
  timeout: 3000,
  errorThresholdPercentage: 50,
  resetTimeout: 30000,
};

const breaker = new CircuitBreaker(paymentService.processPayment, options);
```

### Monitoring

- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Metrics collection with Prometheus

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Data Consistency**: Implemented saga pattern for distributed transactions
2. **Service Discovery**: Used Consul for dynamic service registration
3. **API Gateway**: Kong for request routing and rate limiting

## Results

<Quote>
  "The microservices architecture improved our deployment frequency by 300% and
  reduced downtime to near-zero with blue-green deployments."
</Quote>

- **Performance**: 99.9% uptime achieved
- **Scalability**: Handles 10,000+ concurrent users
- **Development**: 40% faster feature delivery
