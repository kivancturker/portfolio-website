# Optimizing PostgreSQL Queries for Performance

<DateText date="2025-06-15" />

<Callout variant="info">
  PostgreSQL is incredibly powerful, but without proper optimization, even the
  most robust queries can become performance bottlenecks. Let's explore proven
  strategies to make your queries lightning fast.
</Callout>

## Understanding Query Performance

Before optimizing, you need to understand how PostgreSQL executes your queries. The `EXPLAIN` command is your best friend:

<CodeBlock lang="sql">{`
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT u.name, COUNT(p.id) as post_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE u.created_at > '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
ORDER BY post_count DESC;
`}</CodeBlock>

## Common Performance Issues

### 1. Missing Indexes

The most common cause of slow queries is missing or inappropriate indexes:

<CodeBlock lang="sql">{`
-- Slow: Full table scan
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Fast: With index
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
SELECT \* FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
`}</CodeBlock>

### 2. N+1 Query Problem

<Callout variant="warning">
  The N+1 problem occurs when you fetch a list of records and then make
  additional queries for each record.
</Callout>

<CodeBlock lang="sql">{`
-- Bad: N+1 queries
SELECT * FROM users;
-- Then for each user:
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = ?;

-- Good: Single optimized query
SELECT
u.\*,
COALESCE(
JSON_AGG(
JSON_BUILD_OBJECT(
'id', p.id,
'title', p.title,
'content', p.content
)
) FILTER (WHERE p.id IS NOT NULL),
'[]'
) as posts
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
GROUP BY u.id;
`}</CodeBlock>

## Index Optimization Strategies

### 1. Composite Indexes

Order matters in composite indexes:

<CodeBlock lang="sql">{`
-- If you frequently query by status and created_at
CREATE INDEX idx_posts_status_created ON posts(status, created_at);

-- This index can serve queries like:
SELECT _ FROM posts WHERE status = 'published';
SELECT _ FROM posts WHERE status = 'published' AND created_at > '2024-01-01';

-- But NOT efficiently:
SELECT \* FROM posts WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01'; -- Missing status
`}</CodeBlock>

### 2. Partial Indexes

Save space and improve performance with partial indexes:

<CodeBlock lang="sql">{`
-- Only index published posts
CREATE INDEX idx_posts_published_created 
ON posts(created_at) 
WHERE status = 'published';

-- Much smaller than indexing all posts
-- Perfect for queries on published content
`}</CodeBlock>

## Query Writing Best Practices

### 1. Use LIMIT Wisely

<CodeBlock lang="sql">{`
-- Instead of fetching everything and limiting in application
SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Use OFFSET carefully (it's slow for large offsets)
-- Better: Use cursor-based pagination
SELECT \* FROM posts
WHERE created_at < ?last_created_at
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
`}</CodeBlock>

### 2. Avoid SELECT \*

<CodeBlock lang="sql">{`
-- Bad: Fetches unnecessary data
SELECT * FROM users JOIN profiles ON users.id = profiles.user_id;

-- Good: Only select what you need
SELECT u.id, u.name, p.bio
FROM users u
JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id;
`}</CodeBlock>

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Window Functions vs Subqueries

<CodeBlock lang="sql">{`
-- Instead of correlated subqueries
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE user_id = u.id) as post_count
FROM users u;

-- Use window functions
SELECT DISTINCT
u.id,
u.name,
COUNT(p.id) OVER (PARTITION BY u.id) as post_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id;
`}</CodeBlock>

### 2. Materialized Views for Complex Aggregations

<CodeBlock lang="sql">{`
-- For expensive aggregations that don't need real-time data
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_stats AS
SELECT 
  u.id,
  u.name,
  COUNT(p.id) as post_count,
  AVG(p.view_count) as avg_views,
  MAX(p.created_at) as last_post_date
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.name;

-- Refresh when needed
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW user_stats;
`}</CodeBlock>

  when needed is the root of all good performance."

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Query Performance Monitoring

<CodeBlock lang="sql">{`
-- Enable query logging for slow queries
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_min_duration_statement = 1000; -- Log queries > 1s
SELECT pg_reload_conf();

-- Monitor with pg_stat_statements
SELECT
query,
calls,
total_time,
mean_time,
rows
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
`}</CodeBlock>

### 2. Regular Maintenance

<Callout variant="success">
  Regular maintenance keeps your database performing optimally.
</Callout>

<CodeBlock lang="sql">{`
-- Update table statistics
ANALYZE;

-- Reclaim space and update statistics
VACUUM ANALYZE;

-- For heavily updated tables
REINDEX INDEX idx_posts_status_created;
`}</CodeBlock>

## Conclusion

PostgreSQL optimization is an ongoing process. Start with proper indexing, write efficient queries, and monitor performance regularly. Remember:

1. **Measure first** - Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE
2. **Index strategically** - Don't over-index
3. **Write efficient queries** - Avoid N+1 problems
4. **Monitor continuously** - Track slow queries
5. **Maintain regularly** - VACUUM and ANALYZE
